			Before the official announcement of the iPhone X on September 12, 2017, a HomePod firmware leak suggested that Apple would shortly release a phone with a nearly bezel-less design, lack of physical home button, Face ID, and other new features.[5] Much of the leaked information was confirmed at the keynote.

		<p>
			An iOS 11 GM build was also leaked over the preceding weekend, confirming the new design and features and revealing the new Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE connectivity.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch (diagonal) OLED color-accurate screen that supports DCI-P3 wide color gamut, sRGB, and high dynamic range. This "Super Retina HD Display" has the True Tone technology found on the iPad Pro, which uses six-channel ambient light sensors to adapt the display's white balance to the surrounding ambient light. It has a typical contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, a typical maximum brightness of 625 cd/m2, (or nits), and a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.

		<div class="wdc">
		<p>
			The home button, which made its debut on the original iPhone, has been removed from iPhone X and most of its functions replaced with gestures, as on the home button-less Nokia N9, BlackBerry Z10, and WebOS devices. Some features like Siri and Apple Pay can be used by the new side button.

 					 Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote of her performance, "Alia's role is reminiscent of Kareena Kapoor in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Stylish, classy, born with a silver spoon, she's someone who loves to flaunt not just her clothes and bags, but also her riches. Extremely photogenic, Alia makes a super-confident debut."[14] Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times also mentioned the similarities with Kapoor's character, but noted that her performance was "without the killer attitude."[15] Student of the Year grossed ₹960 million (US$15 million) at the box office.[16]

Her portrayal of a lonely teenage girl who develops stockholm syndrome after being abducted was acclaimed by the critics.[19] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare mentioned that "[a]t 20, it’s surprising how Alia has got so many deft nuances right. It’s as if the actor has grown with the character. She is truly one of the most promising new actors in Hindi films."[20] Sonia Chopra of Sify added that Bhatt is "completely immersed" in her role, and that "Alia’s uninhibited and raw performance will have you emotionally invested in her character all through."[21]

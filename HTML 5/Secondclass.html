			<h1>Impact of IphoneX</h1>
			<p>
				Before the official announcement of the iPhone X on September 12, 2017, a HomePod firmware leak suggested that Apple would shortly release a phone with a nearly bezel-less design, lack of physical home button, Face ID, and other new features.[5] Much of the leaked information was confirmed at the keynote.

				An iOS 11 GM build was also leaked over the preceding weekend, confirming the new design and features and revealing the new Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE connectivity.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch (diagonal) OLED color-accurate screen that supports DCI-P3 wide color gamut, sRGB, and high dynamic range. This "Super Retina HD Display" has the True Tone technology found on the iPad Pro, which uses six-channel ambient light sensors to adapt the display's white balance to the surrounding ambient light. It has a typical contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, a typical maximum brightness of 625 cd/m2, (or nits), and a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.

				The home button, which made its debut on the original iPhone, has been removed from iPhone X and most of its functions replaced with gestures, as on the home button-less Nokia N9, BlackBerry Z10, and WebOS devices. Some features like Siri and Apple Pay can be used by the new side button.

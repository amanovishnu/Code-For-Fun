			Designing a great website may seem like a daunting challenge, but as long as you keep the basics in mind, you will find the process interesting and enjoyable. There's more to it than just looking good! We'll show you the basics, and some general guidelines to help you design websites that keep people coming back.

		<h3>Design Your Own Website</h3>
		<p>
			if you're new to web coding and design but you really want to build a website yourself, there are many options open to you. You can build a simple site by teaching yourself basic html and CSS coding. Just be sure that you can also make it look nice and professional!
		</p>
		<h3>Use a pre-made website template</h3>
		<p>
			 You can purchase or find free pre-made websites very easily on the internet. These are pre-made codes which you simply use and alter to your own needs. There are many reputable providers of templates, but a good one is Wix.
		</p>
		<h3>Hire a website designer</h3>
		<p>
			If you want something tailored to your needs that looks professional and runs great, it's probably a good idea to hire a website designer. While this will definitely cost you money, it won't be as expensive as it sounds. You can get a designer on the cheap by advertising at a local technical college or university. Their experience will help guide you to a more successful, more professional website.
		</p>
		<h3>Streamline your webpage</h3>
		<p>
			 You want everything to be as fast and easy to use as possible. Minimize the number of choices that someone has to make, make navigation extremely self-explanatory, and help them get to what they're looking for as quickly as possible.
